  Thanatology
</h1>



Thanatology is a project built using the Tauri framework to deliver a cross-platform digital forensics desktop application. It leverages the power of the [Exhume toolkit](https://www.forensicxlab.com/docs/exhume) as a core library and uses React with MUI to showcase how a modern application **tailored for law enforcement** can be developed. The goal of Thanatology is to provite an all in one Framework to perform Post-Mortem Analysis, Malware Analysis and Memory Analysis. The project is also meant to include helpfull judicial tools for a court acceptable digital forensics report.
